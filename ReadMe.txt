We provide prototype code of our paper "Saliency as Evidence: Event Detection with Trigger Saliency Attribution".

The code structures are:

1) `sentence_label_predict_ace.py` contains code for training a sentence-level event classifier; 

2) `salient_evluation.py` contains code for using the sentence-level classifier for trigger saliency attribution.

3) `event_detection_train_ace.py` contains code for grouping event types into different categories and training separate ED models.

4ï¼‰`event_detection_train_ace.py` contains code for evaluation.
